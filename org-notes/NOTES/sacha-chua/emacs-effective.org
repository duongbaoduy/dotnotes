* How can I use org-mode for emacs effectively?
  Here's one path that could help you learn Org:
  1. Read the Org manual. Read the entire thing, even if you don't understand most of it. Reread as you absorb more.
  2. Get the hang of using Org as an outliner. See The Org Manual
  3. Learn how to search and browse around.
  4. Learn how to use Org to track TODO states. See The Org Manual
  5. Use C-c [ to add Org files to your agenda list, and learn how to schedule tasks. See The Org Manual and The Org Manual
  6. Set up org-capture so that you can save notes to your Org file. The Org Manual
  7. Learn how to archive, now that your Org file is getting pretty big. The Org Manual
  8. Learn how to use tags and search. The Org Manual
  9. Customize your Org agenda even further (org-agenda-custom-commands).
  
I blog about how I use Org (org " sacha chua) - maybe some of the posts might be helpful too. =)
